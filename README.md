## Features

- Easy enable/disable of any mod, not just auto-updated ones
- Easy dependency handling for things such as UniverseLib for mods that need it

## Installation
1. Download [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest) and install it onto your `Neon White.exe`.
2. Run the game once. This will create required folders.
3. Download `WhitesStorage.dll` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/stxticOVFL/WhitesStorage/releases/latest) and drop it in the **`Plugins`** (__***NOT***__ `Mods`) folder.
4. Enable the mods you want using the preferences manager (using F5) and just restart whenever you make changes!

## Building & Contributing
This project uses Visual Studio 2022 as its project manager. When opening the Visual Studio solution, ensure your references are corrected by right clicking and selecting `Add Reference...` as shown below. 
Both `MelonLoader` and `Mono.Cecil` will be in `Neon White/MelonLoader/net35`, **not** `net6`.
If you get any weird errors, try deleting the references and re-adding them manually.
